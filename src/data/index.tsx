If that sounds compelling, it`s time to introduce Tailwind CSS into your front-end toolbox. Tailwind CSS is a revolutionary utility-first CSS framework for rapidly constructing custom user interfaces. It offers a different approach from traditional CSS libraries, enabling developers to work directly on HTML, adding classes instead of writing separate CSS selector rules. This paradigm shift may seem unusual, but it brings with it a host of advantages, transforming your development experience into a smoother journey.",

      "As an aspiring web developer, you`ve likely spent hours meticulously constructing applications using modern JavaScript syntax, only to find it`s incompatible with some browsers. This frustration is common in the world of web development. Thankfully, there`s a tool that can help overcome this problem: Babel. (See full docs: https://babeljs.io/) Babel is an open-source JavaScript compiler that plays a central role in numerous web applications. It bridges the gap between cutting-edge JavaScript code and older browsers that struggle to understand it. Babel transforms ECMAScript 2015+ (ES6+) code into a backward-compatible version, a process often referred to as “transpiling.” Babel can perform various tasks, including syntax transformation, filling missing features in your target environment through a third-party polyfill like core-js, conducting source code transformations (codemods), and more. It`s important to note that Babel`s role goes beyond syntax conversion — it also brings forward compatibility for new native APIs.",
